## For children and young people

Some days can feel extra hard, but you're not alone. It might feel scary or silly to talk about how you're feeling, but it's really important. Try and talk to an adult you trust - maybe someone in your family, a doctor, or a teacher at school. They can help you work out your worries and arrange for you to get support if you need it.

You can get help 24/7 from the options below. These are free and *confidential*, which means that what you say won't be shared with other people - **unless they think you or someone else is in danger**.
