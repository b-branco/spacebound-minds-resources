# Welcome back, astronauts!

In **Spacebound Minds**, you tested out what life could be like on another planet. We learned that we need lots more than just food, water and air to live a happy and healthy life. Our scientists shared that sleeping well, being active and socialising with friends and family were also important for looking after our well-being. 

Armed with all this new knowledge, we built and decorated a model of what our space station *could* look like, with lots of ways for people of all ages to stay happy and healthy. Now that all the hard work is done, it's time for you to buckle up and get ready for launch! 

Watch the tour of the whole space station, and see if you can spot your own happy place:

Check out the links on the sidebar to find out more about mental health and wellbeing, and what you can do if you need support.

<!-- It would be great to have tabs at the top of the page that link to each of the subheadings -->
