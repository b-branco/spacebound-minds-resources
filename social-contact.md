# Social connection – friends are not just fun, they are necessary!

## Why is socialising important for our physical and mental health?

Spending time with friends and family isn’t just fun — it’s seriously good for you. Social connection can lead to improved mood, better health, and a longer life.

## What happens when we feel lonely? 

When we feel lonely, especially for long periods of time, our brains, bodies, and behaviour begin to change. We may feel more anxious and angry, we get sick more easily, our brains and bodies age faster, and we may not find activities as fun as we used to.

Think about a time when you felt really scared of something. Maybe you saw a spider, got chased by a dog, or someone gave you a fright. You probably felt your heart racing wildly, right? Well, even though it might not feel exactly the same, your body actually responds to feelings of loneliness in a very similar way to things that make us afraid. When you feel lonely, your brain tries to cope by setting off a kind of alarm system in your body known as the HPA axis. The brain signals to the adrenal glands to release cortisol, which is a stress hormone. Usually this helps us to kick into action, but high levels of cortisol for long periods of time can disrupt your brain's ability to talk to other parts of your body. This can cause many problems for us, including: 

-	Causing problems for our hearts
-	Making us feel more anxious and angry
-	Making us get sick more easily 
-	Making our brains and bodies age faster

## So, how do we feel more connected?

Social connection is about the quality of our interactions, not the quantity of friends we have. To feel connected, you don't necessarily need a lot of friends. Focus on forming strong bonds with a few good friends and family members and spend regular time with them. There are lots of ways to connect with people, such as playing games together, asking each other questions, and making sure to listen carefully to each other! This will reduce cortisol levels in your body and promote well-being. And don’t forget: spending some time alone is totally okay too. It’s all about balance!
