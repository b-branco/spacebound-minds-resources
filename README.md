# Spacebound Minds online resources

This repository is part of the Spacebound Minds workshop delivered by researchers at the University of Edinburgh. It holds online mental health resources that young people and guardians can access after attending our workshop.

## Information for maintainers

- Use *index.md* and the other markdown files to add, remove and edit resources.
- *_config.yml* holds information about the Jekyll theme + website name and description.
- To make changes to the colouring or styling, edit *assets/css/style.scss*.
- Modify *_layouts/default.html* to edit the layout of the pages.
  - If you make changes to the favicons, make sure this repository's URL is harcoded into the href - otherwise the browser will look for the icons in my personal repo instead(!).
- *particles.json* controls the interactive constellations in the banner.

The Spacebound Minds website is built using GitHub pages and the [Cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman). 
For the constellations in the banner, we use the awesome [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) library by VincentGarreau.
